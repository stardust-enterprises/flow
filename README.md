## Usage

This is missing a usage section, I'll get to it when I'm happy with the API/DSL, right now it's a bit janky at best.

In the meantime, see either [this project's buildscript](build.gradle.kts) or [propy's buildscript](https://codeberg.org/xtrm/propy/src/branch/main/build.gradle.kts) for "inspiration".
